# GDPR Transparency and Consent Framework
Hosted in this repository are the technical specifications for IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework that will help the digital advertising industry interpret and comply with EU rules on data protection and privacy - notably the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that comes into effect on May 25, 2018. 

#### IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework 

In November 2017, IAB Europe and a cross-section of the publishing and advertising industry, announced a new Transparency & Consent Framework to help publishers, advertisers and technology companies comply with key elements of GDPR. The Framework will give the publishing and advertising industries a common language with which to communicate consumer consent for the delivery of relevant online advertising and content. 

The documents published here that support the Framework are draft specifications for public comment from March 8 to April 8 2018. IAB Tech Lab is charged with the technical governance of these specifications.

Public comment period for v1.1 specifications ended April 8, 2018. Feedback for future iterations may be sent to feedback@advertisingconsent.eu and any technical feedback to transparencyframework@iabtechlab.com.
